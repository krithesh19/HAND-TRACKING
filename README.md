# Hand Tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV:
Introduction:
This project utilizes the MediaPipe library and OpenCV to perform real-time hand tracking using a webcam. The script captures video from the default camera (Camera Index 0) and identifies landmarks on the hand, displaying them on the screen in addition to the frames per second (FPS) information.

REQUIREMENTS:
Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:

OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
MediaPipe: pip install mediapipe

Clone the repository:
bash

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking.git

Navigate to the project directory:
bash

Copy code
cd hand-tracking

Run the script:
bash

Copy code
python hand_tracking.py
Press 'Q' to exit the application.

Project Structure
hand_tracking.py: The main script that captures video from the webcam, processes it to detect hand landmarks using MediaPipe, and displays the results in real-time using OpenCV.

README.md: The file you are currently reading, providing information about the project, its setup, and usage.
